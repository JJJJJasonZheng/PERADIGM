PERADIGM: Phenotype Embedding Similarity-based Rare Disease Gene Mapping

This repository contains the R code used for the analysis described in the paper:

PERADIGM: Phenotype Embedding Similarity-based Rare Disease Gene Mapping
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.01.646670v1

The code consists of two main files:
	•	main.R: The primary script that orchestrates data loading, pre-processing, analysis, and output generation.
	•	function.R: A collection of functions supporting the analysis, including regression testing, embedding computations, similarity scoring, carrier processing, and permutation testing.
